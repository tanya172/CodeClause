# CodeClause
This repository contains all the projects that I have built during my Internship as a Python Developer at CodeClause

This Project contains a Music Player which curates an MP3 player using Tkinter and Pygame.
In creating an MP3 player, I used a mixer class to load and unload the playlist. In addition, mixer class functions to play, pause, and stop the MP3 file have been used.
